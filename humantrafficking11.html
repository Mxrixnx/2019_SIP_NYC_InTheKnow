      <p><center class="second"id="drugg">What is it?</center></p>
      <p><center class="third">This is when somebody is forced to carry out criminal activity through coercion or deception. Forced criminality can take many forms, including:
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Drug trade, e.g. cannabis cultivation, drug distribution</li>
          <li>Begging</li>
          <li>Pick-pocketing</li>
          <li>Bag snatching</li>
          <li>ATM theft</li>
          <li>Selling of counterfeit goods</li>
        </ul>
        Forced criminality also encompasses social welfare fraud. This takes place when exploiters falsely apply for tax credits and other welfare benefits using the victims’ details. It is not only the state that is the victim of social welfare fraud, there is often horrific abuse used against the individual in order to coerce them into falsely applying for benefits.
